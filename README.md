this api is a part of a fullstack project , backend(.net) , frontend(angular), database(azure)

This project is an API developed in .NET that provides services related to employee and department management. The API allows clients to perform various operations, such as listing departments and employees, creating new employees, updating employee information, and deleting employees. It uses a database (SQL Server) for data storage and includes features like Swagger for API documentation and AutoMapper for mapping between data models and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects). The API also implements CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies to allow cross-origin requests, which can be useful for web applications that need to interact with the API.
